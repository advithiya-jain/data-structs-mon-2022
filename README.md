# Data Structures Monsoon 2022
Public Repo for all code I write in the Data Structures Class (CS-1203) @ Ashoka University. 

## Folders
The 'class-and-test-programs' folder contains programs that have to be done for learning and grades (given during lectures in class).

The 'own-random-progs' folder contains extra programs that I am doing for practice/self-learning. These could be random problems I came up with, or some problem from the internet.
